## üìä What Each Tool Does

### Prometheus üìà
**"The Data Collector"**
- Collects numeric metrics from your app
- Stores time-series data
- Provides PromQL query language
- Sends alerts when thresholds are breached

**Your documentation:** Sections in OBSERVABILITY_EXPLAINED.md and cheatsheet queries

### Grafana üìä
**"The Visualizer"**
- Creates beautiful dashboards from Prometheus data
- Provides graphs, gauges, tables, etc.
- Manages alerts and notifications
- Allows team collaboration

**Your documentation:** Tutorial Part 2, example dashboards in `/docs/examples/`

### Jaeger üîç
**"The Request Tracker"**
- Traces requests through your system
- Shows where time is spent
- Helps debug slow requests
- Identifies bottlenecks

**Your documentation:** Tutorial Part 3, OBSERVABILITY_EXPLAINED.md Jaeger section

### Example Files
Located in `/docs/examples/`:
- `prometheus.yml` - Prometheus configuration example
- `prometheus-alerts.yml` - Alert rule examples

## üöÄ Getting Started (5 Minutes)

1. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/george/Documents/github/charity-management-system
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the UIs:**
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin123)
   - Jaeger: http://localhost:16686

3. **Generate some data:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/volunteers
   curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
   ```

4. **View your first metric:**
   - Open Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Enter query: `http_requests_total`
   - Click "Execute"

**Congratulations!** You just collected and viewed your first metric! üéâ
