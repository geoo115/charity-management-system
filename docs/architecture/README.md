# System Architecture Overview

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Charity Management System proof-of-concept, including component diagrams, data flow visualizations, and deployment architecture that demonstrate modern system design principles.

## Architecture Diagrams

### Component Architecture
- [**Component Diagram**](./component-diagram.mermaid) - High-level system component overview
- [**Data Flow Diagram**](./data-flow-diagram.mermaid) - Request/response flow patterns
- [**Database ERD**](./database-erd.mermaid) - Enhanced entity relationship diagram

### Deployment Architecture  
- [**Deployment Diagram**](./deployment-architecture.mermaid) - Production infrastructure layout
- [**Network Architecture**](./network-architecture.mermaid) - Network topology and security boundaries

### User Journey Flows
- [**Authentication Flow**](./auth-flow.mermaid) - User authentication and authorization
- [**Help Request Flow**](./help-request-flow.mermaid) - Complete help request lifecycle
- [**Donation Flow**](./donation-flow.mermaid) - Donation processing workflow

## Viewing Diagrams

### In VS Code
Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension to view diagrams directly in markdown preview.

### Online Viewers
- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) - Copy/paste diagram code
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Native mermaid rendering in markdown files

### Local Rendering
```bash
# Install mermaid CLI
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Render diagram to PNG
mmdc -i component-diagram.mermaid -o component-diagram.png
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
- Clear separation by user roles (visitor, donor, volunteer, staff, admin)
- Business logic encapsulated in domain services
- Shared components for cross-cutting concerns

### 2. Clean Architecture
- Dependencies flow inward toward business logic
- Infrastructure details abstracted behind interfaces
- Testable business logic independent of frameworks

### 3. Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling through stateless design
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

### 4. Security by Design
- Authentication and authorization at multiple layers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### 5. Observability First
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Distributed tracing for complex workflows
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
