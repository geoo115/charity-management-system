# ADR-004: Observability Stack Selection

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-26  
**Authors**: DevOps and Backend Teams  
**Reviewers**: System Architects and Operations Team

## Context
The Charity Management System requires comprehensive observability to ensure reliable operation for critical charity workflows:
- **Service Reliability**: Monitor help request processing, donation handling, volunteer coordination
- **Performance Tracking**: API response times, database query performance, cache hit rates
- **Error Detection**: Application errors, failed donations, WebSocket connection issues
- **Business Metrics**: Donation volumes, volunteer activity, help request resolution times
- **Debugging Support**: Distributed tracing for complex workflows, log correlation

The system needs to support both development debugging and production monitoring, with alerting for critical business processes. Cost considerations include both infrastructure and operational overhead for a charity organization.

## Decision
We will use the **Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger** observability stack with structured logging, providing comprehensive metrics, visualization, and distributed tracing capabilities.

**Complete Stack:**
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and visualization
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Pros**: 
  - Excellent log search and analysis
  - Rich query language (Lucene)
  - Good for text-heavy log analysis
  - Mature ecosystem and tooling
- **Cons**: 
  - High resource consumption (especially Elasticsearch)
  - Complex setup and maintenance
  - Expensive for metrics storage compared to Prometheus
  - Over-engineered for current log volume
- **Why not chosen**: Too resource-intensive for current scale and primarily optimized for log search rather than metrics

### Option 2: New Relic / DataDog (SaaS Solutions)
- **Pros**: 
  - Zero infrastructure maintenance
  - Advanced AI-powered insights
  - Comprehensive APM features
  - Professional support
- **Cons**: 
  - High monthly costs for charity budget
  - Vendor lock-in concerns
  - Data privacy considerations
  - Limited customization for charity-specific metrics
- **Why not chosen**: Cost-prohibitive for charity organization, preference for open-source solutions

### Option 3: Single Tool Solutions (e.g., Zipkin only, Grafana Cloud)
- **Pros**: 
  - Simpler setup and maintenance
  - Lower learning curve
  - Reduced operational overhead
  - Cost-effective
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited functionality compared to full stack
  - Vendor lock-in for cloud solutions
  - May not scale with growing needs
  - Missing integrated correlation between metrics and traces
- **Why not chosen**: Insufficient for comprehensive production monitoring needs

### Option 4: Custom Built Observability
- **Pros**: 
  - Tailored exactly to needs
  - No vendor lock-in
  - Complete control over features
  - Cost-effective for specific requirements
- **Cons**: 
  - Significant development and maintenance overhead
  - Missing battle-tested features
  - Team expertise requirements
  - Reinventing the wheel
- **Why not chosen**: Development effort better spent on charity domain features

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Metrics, logs, and traces in integrated stack
- **Cost-Effective**: Open-source solutions with reasonable infrastructure costs
- **Industry Standard**: Well-documented, widely adopted tools
- **Customizable**: Highly configurable for charity-specific needs
- **Community Support**: Large communities and extensive documentation
- **Scalable**: Can grow with system requirements
- **Correlation**: Easy correlation between metrics, logs, and traces

### Negative
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires setup, maintenance, and monitoring of monitoring stack
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn multiple tools and concepts
- **Resource Usage**: Additional infrastructure required for monitoring stack
- **Complexity**: Multiple moving parts to coordinate and troubleshoot

### Neutral
- **Vendor Independence**: No vendor lock-in, but also no vendor support
- **Customization**: High flexibility requires more configuration effort

## Implementation Notes

**Current Prometheus Metrics:**
```go
// HTTP metrics by method, route, status, and user role
http_requests_total{method="POST", route="/api/v1/help-requests", status="200", role="visitor"}
http_request_duration_seconds{method="GET", route="/api/v1/dashboard", role="admin"}

// Database metrics
db_query_duration_seconds{operation="INSERT", table="help_requests"}
db_connection_pool_size{state="open"}
db_connection_pool_size{state="idle"}

// Cache metrics  
redis_operations_total{operation="GET", result="hit"}
redis_operations_total{operation="SET", result="success"}

// Business metrics
help_requests_created_total{category="food_assistance", priority="high"}
donations_processed_total{type="monetary", status="completed"}
volunteer_shifts_total{status="completed"}

// WebSocket metrics
websocket_connections_active{user_role="volunteer"}
websocket_messages_sent_total{type="notification"}
```

**Grafana Dashboard Structure:**
```
/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/
├── application-overview.json      # High-level system health
├── api-performance.json           # API response times and errors
├── database-performance.json      # Database queries and connections
├── business-metrics.json          # Charity-specific KPIs
├── infrastructure.json            # Server resources and health
└── websocket-activity.json        # Real-time connection health
```

**Jaeger Tracing Implementation:**
- Traces for complete help request workflows
- Donation processing end-to-end tracking
- Volunteer shift assignment flows
- Cross-service calls and database operations
- WebSocket message routing traces

**AlertManager Configuration:**
```yaml
# Critical business process alerts
- alert: HelpRequestProcessingFailure
  expr: rate(help_requests_failed_total[5m]) > 0.1
  
- alert: DonationProcessingDown  
  expr: rate(donations_failed_total[5m]) > 0.05
  
- alert: DatabaseConnectionExhaustion
  expr: db_connection_pool_usage > 0.9

- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
```

**Structured Logging Strategy:**
```go
logger.Info("help request created",
    "request_id", requestID,
    "user_id", userID,
    "category", request.Category,
    "priority", request.Priority,
    "trace_id", traceID,
)
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- Metric retention: 30 days detailed, 1 year aggregated
- Log retention: 7 days full text, 30 days summary
- Trace sampling: 10% in production, 100% in development
- Alert noise reduction through proper thresholds
