# ADR-001: Monolith to Microservices Readiness Strategy

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-26  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: System Architects

## Context
The Charity Management System currently operates as a well-structured monolith serving multiple user types (visitors, donors, volunteers, staff, admins) with distinct workflows. As the system grows, we need to decide when and how to potentially transition to microservices architecture while maintaining development velocity and system reliability.

The current monolith handles:
- Authentication and user management across 5 user roles
- Donation processing and tracking
- Volunteer coordination and shift management
- Help request management
- Real-time notifications via WebSocket
- Document management and file storage
- Analytics and reporting

## Decision
We will maintain the current monolith architecture with strategic preparation for future microservices migration when specific thresholds are met.

**Migration Triggers:**
1. **Team Size**: When development team exceeds 15 developers
2. **Request Volume**: When processing >10,000 requests/minute consistently
3. **Data Volume**: When database size exceeds 500GB with performance degradation
4. **Feature Complexity**: When domain boundaries become clearly defined with minimal cross-cutting concerns

**Preparation Strategy:**
- Maintain clear domain boundaries in current code structure (`handlers_new/` by user role)
- Continue using dependency injection for easy service extraction
- Keep database models loosely coupled with clear ownership
- Implement comprehensive API contracts via OpenAPI/Swagger
- Maintain separate business logic in `services/` layer

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Immediate Microservices Migration
- **Pros**: 
  - Independent deployment and scaling
  - Technology diversity per service
  - Better team autonomy
- **Cons**: 
  - Significant development overhead with current team size (estimated 3-4 developers)
  - Network latency and complexity for inter-service communication
  - Operational overhead for deployment, monitoring, and debugging
- **Why not chosen**: Premature optimization for current scale and team size

### Option 2: Modular Monolith with Clear Boundaries
- **Pros**: 
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easier testing and maintenance
  - Preparation for future service extraction
- **Cons**: 
  - Still single deployment unit
  - Shared database and runtime
- **Why not chosen**: Already partially implemented; this decision includes this approach

### Option 3: Serverless Functions Architecture  
- **Pros**: 
  - Automatic scaling
  - Pay-per-execution model
  - No infrastructure management
- **Cons**: 
  - Cold start latency for WebSocket connections
  - Vendor lock-in concerns
  - Complexity for stateful operations (volunteer shift management)
- **Why not chosen**: Not suitable for real-time features and stateful workflows

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Development Velocity**: Faster feature development with single codebase
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single deployment, monitoring, and debugging surface
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower infrastructure and operational costs
- **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions across all operations
- **Future Ready**: Clean domain boundaries enable smooth future migration

### Negative
- **Single Point of Failure**: One service failure affects entire system
- **Technology Lock-in**: Shared technology stack across all domains
- **Scaling Limitations**: Cannot scale individual components independently
- **Team Dependencies**: All developers work in same codebase

### Neutral
- **Performance**: Adequate for current load with room for optimization
- **Maintenance**: Standard monolith maintenance patterns apply
- **Testing**: Integration testing simpler, unit testing requires discipline

## Implementation Notes

**Current Architecture Preservation:**

```

**Migration Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] API contracts documented and stable
- [ ] Domain boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] Database schema supports service separation
- [ ] Monitoring and logging per domain
- [ ] Authentication/authorization service-ready

**Monitoring Migration Triggers:**
- Track request volume via Prometheus metrics
- Monitor database performance and size
- Assess team productivity and development bottlenecks
- Review domain coupling through code analysis
